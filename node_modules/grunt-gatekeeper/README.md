Grunt-Gatekeeper
============

Spin up Gatekeeper instances with Grunt!

Requirements
============

At this time it requires gatekeeper installed globally.

Notes
=====

This module is intended to be used in conjunction with a watch task. As such the gatekeeper instances are closed when the task chain completes. 

```javascript
grunt.registerTask('dev', ['clean','build:dev','gatekeeper:dev','watch:dev']);
```

Config
======

Here is an example config file

```javascript
// Gate Keeper
gatekeeper: {
  dev: {
    app: {
      serverPort: 9000,
      assetPath: 'dist/dev',
    },
    api: {
      serverPort: 3001,
      forwardHost: "localhost",
      forwardPort: 3000,
    },
  },
},
```

All children of `gatekeeper` are tasks. All children of tasks are gatekeeper instances to be spun up.

#### Serving static assets

include a `serverPort` and an `assetPath`

#### Forwarding traffic

include a `serverPort`, a `forwardHost`, and a `forwardPort`
